rePhoto is a citizen science web application designed to create a simpler environment for users to take repeat photography of a subject. This is done through rePhoto providing layered imagery such that the user can align their camera with the previous image of the current subject. Furthermore, rePhoto allows users to create their own projects or to simply and easily find local projects or projects relevant to a user's interests to contribute to.
